### Skateboard Deck

#### Description
The deck of a skateboard is the main part of it. It is the part that you stand on to ride it. The one I made is tan with a black top. 

#### Evidence

##### The holes are used to connect the deck with the other parts of the skateboard using bolts.

#### Reflection
The deck was pretty simple. I've never used the hole tool. Its nice to have a tool that can be used to automatically create a hole where you need it without the extra step of drawing the circle to extrude it.

### Truck Baseplate

#### Description
This is the part of the skateboard that holds the truck hanger to the deck. There are two of these on each end of the skateboard.

#### Evidence

##### This is a bottom view of the baseplate. The four holes line up with the ones on the deck.

#### Reflection
In order to get the baseplate to line up with the holes in the deck, I needed to use the offset tool to copy the square used for the holes but instead make them slightly larger so they can be extruded with a new part. That way I could have the holes carry through to the baseplate and be used to connect the two parts.

### Truck Hanger

#### Description
A cylinder that has two extended smaller cylinders poking out of the ends of it. It is connected to the truck baseplate and is used to hold the wheels on.

#### Evidence

##### This an image of it with the truck baseplate and deck showing. The hanger is the highlighted one. It is connected to the baseplate in two areas. One is a part extended off to cuff around a cylinder sticking out of the baseplate. The other is just another cylinder that is connected directly to the baseplate.

#### Reflection
This was another simple part with the only slightly difficult thing being making the fillets on the weird cuff part.
