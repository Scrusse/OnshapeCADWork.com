### Skateboard Deck

#### Description
The deck of a skateboard is the main part of it. It is the part that you stand on to ride it. The one I made is tan with a black top. 

#### Evidence

##### The holes are used to connect the deck with the other parts of the skateboard using bolts.

#### Reflection
The deck was pretty simple. I've never used the hole tool. Its nice to have a tool that can be used to automatically create a hole where you need it without the extra step of drawing the circle to extrude it.

### Truck Baseplate

#### Description
This is the part of the skateboard that holds the truck hanger to the deck. There are two of these on each end of the skateboard.

#### Evidence

##### This is a bottom view of the baseplate. The four holes line up with the ones on the deck.

#### Reflection
In order to get the baseplate to line up with the holes in the deck, I needed to use the offset tool to copy the square used for the holes but instead make them slightly larger so they can be extruded with a new part. That way I could have the holes carry through to the baseplate and be used to connect the two parts.

### Truck Hanger

#### Description
A cylinder that has two extended smaller cylinders poking out of the ends of it. It is connected to the truck baseplate and is used to hold the wheels on.

#### Evidence

##### This an image of it with the truck baseplate and deck showing. The hanger is the highlighted one. It is connected to the baseplate in two areas. One is a part extended off to cuff around a cylinder sticking out of the baseplate. The other is just another cylinder that is connected directly to the baseplate.

#### Reflection
This was another simple part with the only slightly difficult thing being making the fillets on the weird cuff part.

### Wheel and Bearing

#### Description
I think we all know what wheels do, but not everyone know what a bearing is/does. A bearing consists of 3 parts (not modeled in onshape): The outer layer, the metal balls, and the inner layer. The inner layer and the outer layer can spin independently of eachother thanks to the metal balls between them. Now that you know how that works, I can explain how it works in correlation to the wheel and the skateboard unsing images.

#### Evidence

##### This is an image of the wheel and bearing alone. As you can see, the entire bearing is fit into the side of the wheel (another bearing is also on the other side). The wheel is the black cylinder and the bearing is the red one inside.

##### This is an image of the inside of the wheel connected to the truck hanger. The inside layer of the bearing stays still while the balls between the two bearing layers allow the outer layer to spin with the wheel. Get it?

#### Reflection
The revolve tool is so useful. Instead of having to extrude two different parts to get the outside and the inside of the wheel, I could just make two triangles that are next to eachother and then revolve them around a point and get a nice perfect circle with another section on the inside. It just simply removes steps overall, very useful.

### Full Assembly

#### Definition
This is the full assembly of all of the parts mentioned in this document. (Surprising, right?) There is one part that wasn't mentioned in this document and thats because its extremely simple. The bushing is just a cylinder that was filleted on one of the edges to make it half round and half straight. All it does is separate the truck baseplate and the truck hanger. I just didn't think it needed its own section.

#### Evidence

##### This is an overall image of the assembly. It shows the deck along with the truck parts and wheels. As you can see, there are bolts in place where they are a supposed to be. Those are already part of onshape and I didn't have to make them myself.

##### This is a close up of the truck parts, the wheels, the deck, and the bolts connecting them all. This shows how the busing looks (the donut-ish looking thing between the thing sticking out of the truck hanger and the truck baseplate). It also shows the outside of the wheel. There is a bolt connecting the wheel to the truck hanger.

#### Reflection
This overall assembly was pretty simple considering I had made a lot of the parts in the same documents (take notes future self). Doing that helped me confirm that the parts would fit together and all I had to do in the assembly was insert the parts and add the bolts and nuts. Mating in Onshape is way easier than it is in Solidworks. All I had to do was select a mate, select a part, and connect it to a mate connector. Only takes a few steps and is really simple.
