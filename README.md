## Skateboard CAD Project

### Description
A skateboard made in Onshape. It has a tan-colored board and black wheels with red bearings. 

### Evidence

#### This is the top of the skateboard. It shows the deck with the holes for the bolts that hold the trucks to it.

#### This is the bottom of the skateboard. It is way more interesting than the top. It shows the truck baseplates, the truck hangers, the bushings, and the wheels.

### Reflection
This project was really helpful with teaching me how to use tools. For example, the replicate tool can be used to fill a bunch of identical holes on a face with bolts in assemblies. Not only that, but (surprisingly) in this assignment I learned that I could make seperate parts using extrude.
